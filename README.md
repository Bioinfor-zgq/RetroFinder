# RetroFinder
RetroFinder is a tool of the universal pipeline, which is convenient for researchers to use it to quickly and comprehensively identity and analyze retrocopies in the genomes.

It uses the protein coding sequences as templates to align with the whole genome and integrates a series of bioinformatics tools (tblastn, LAST, FASTA, exonerate, clustalw, KaKs_Calculator, BEDtools, HISAT2, StringTie, Shiny, etc.) to scan retrocopies. What's more, it also can analyze heterosense substitution and synonymous substitution, compare the structure of parental genes and retrocopies and calculate the expression of them. In addition, this tool provides displays the information and analysis results in an intuitive graphical interface using the Shiny package in R. RetroFinder can be installed directly by docker and conda or downloading the source code from github (http)
